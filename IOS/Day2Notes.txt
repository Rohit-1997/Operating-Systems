Process: Its an instance of an excuting program
A Process contains:
- State of Excution: Inculdes Program counters, stack
Program counter - used to schedule the processes
Stack pointer - switch between the processes 


The process looks like the following:

stack	- To store the process calls
heap	- dynaminc memory 
data	- Static when the program loads
text	- static whent the program loads

The representation is called as an adress space. This is a virtual adress space
The mapping of the virtual adress space to the actual adress space in the physical memory is done using Page tables and the OS takes care of that.


Process Control Block:
It's a data structure that the OS maintains for the process that it manages.
What does it contain?
	- Program counter
	- process state
	- process number, .... and things related to a process
This is important as the PCB stores the current state of the process

Different states:
- Running
- Waiting
- Terminated

hot cache and cold cache?

Daemon Process: It's the first process that executes. Parent of all the processes
fork: this command is used to create a child process
